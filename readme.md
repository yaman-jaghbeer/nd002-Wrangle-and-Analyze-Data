## What is this?
This is my project submission to Udacity as part of the course: "Data Analyst Nanodegree".

The project title is: Wrangle and Analyze Data

## Project Overview (from Udacity):

**Context**

Your goal: wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, 
but it only contains very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

**The Data**

Enhanced Twitter Archive

The WeRateDogs Twitter archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets, but not everything. One column the archive does 
contain though: each tweet's text, which I used to extract rating, dog name, and dog "stage" (i.e. doggo, floofer, pupper, and puppo) 
to make this Twitter archive "enhanced." Of the 5000+ tweets, I have filtered for tweets with ratings only (there are 2356).

**How to Query Twitter Data**

In this project, you'll be using Tweepy to query Twitter's API for additional data beyond the data included in the WeRateDogs Twitter
archive. This additional data will include retweet count and favorite count.

## How to contribute:
Feel free to fork the repository and work with it. It is useful for learning data wrangling.
